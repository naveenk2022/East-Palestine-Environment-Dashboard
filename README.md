# East-Palestine-Environment-Dashboard

A repo containing data and scripts for creating a dashboard to map the environmental impact of the East Palestine train derailment on February 3rd, 2023.

This repo contains:

  - Shapefiles obtained from government sources.
  - Air quality data obtained from AirNow using their API.
  - Water quality data obtained from USGS (United States Geological Survey).
  - Scripts written in Python for wrangling and cleaning the data.
  - Quarto files that have code for creating a dashboard that is hosted on Shiny. 
  
The cleaned water quality data and air quality data are hosted here in addition to the raw data obtained directly from the sources mentioned above. 

Some of the larger files have been compressed into .7z files. 

The final dashboard can be found here: https://naveen-kannan.shinyapps.io/final_east_palestine_dashboard_2/

This constitues the final project for PQHS 427 at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland.
